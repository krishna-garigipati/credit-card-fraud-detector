# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system using **Machine Learning**. The model is trained on a dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions and uses **XGBoost** to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for fraud detection
- Model training and evaluation using **XGBoost**
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
- Handles class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimized model performance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized credit card transaction records, with features representing different transaction attributes. Due to privacy concerns, real transaction details are not disclosed. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. 

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for preprocessing and evaluation)
- **XGBoost** (for model training)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)


## Usage
- The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`credit_fraud_detection.ipynb`) that walks through data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- After training, the model can be used to predict fraudulent transactions on new data.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Identifies how many detected frauds are actual frauds.
- **Recall**: Determines the ability of the model to detect fraud cases.
- **F1-score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC Curve**: Evaluates the model's classification performance.

## Results
The trained model achieves high performance with optimized precision and recall, ensuring effective fraud detection while minimizing false positives.
